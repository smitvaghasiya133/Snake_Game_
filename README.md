# Snake_Game_

This is a classic Snake game implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible.

## Features

- Responsive and intuitive controls for snake movement.
- Snake grows longer each time it consumes food.
- Random spawning of food items.
- Game over when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's performance.
- Basic sound effects for added engagement.

2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Try to eat the food items that appear on the screen to grow the snake and earn points.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. Your score will be displayed on the screen.
